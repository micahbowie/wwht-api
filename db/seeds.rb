 why:"URL's are most commonly used to reference web pages (http), but are also used for file transfer (ftp), email (mailto), database access (JDBC), and many other applications.", what: "A URL stands for Uniform Resource Locator. It is a reference to a web resource that specifies its location on a computer network and a mechanism for retrieving it.", how:"URL = scheme:[//authority]path[?query][#fragment]https://github.com/", term_id:1, up_vote: 0},
{why:"API's are built with the intentions to allow 3rd party developers to build interesting applications using company data. An example is how third party apps allow you to log in with your Gmail credentials.", what: "API stands for Application Programming Interface. Is a computing interface that defines interactions between multiple software intermediaries. It defines the kinds of calls or requests that can be made and how to make them.", how:"There should be detailed documentation on how to use the specific API you want. In general you will fetch information from the API and then do something with that API." , term_id:2, up_vote: 0},
{why: "DOM is used to display an HTML file. The DOM is an object oriented representation of an HTML document that acts as an interface between JavaScript and the document itself. This allows the creation of dynamic web pages", what: "DOM stands for Document Object Model. The DOM represents a document with a logical tree. When a web page is loaded, the browser creates a Document Object Model of the page.", how:"The DOM is created and viewed every time a webpage is created. There are a lot of possibilities to interact with the DOM but, it can only be manipulated using JavaScript.", term_id:3, up_vote: 0},
{why:"OOP is a popular paradigm to use with many benefits. Two popular reasons are its similarities to real life objects and structures which makes it easy to understand. It also allows you to break down your software into bite-sized problems that you then can solve â€” one object at a time.", what:"OOP stands for Object-oriented programming. It is a programming paradigm based on the concept of 'objects', which can contain data (often known as attributes or properties) and behavior(often known as methods).", how: "The paradigm is used in many languages such as (ava, JavaScript, Ruby, TypeScript, Swift, and more.", term_id:4, up_vote: 0},{why:"By using JSX you can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.",what:"JSX is a snytax extension to JavaScript used in React.",how:"JSX looks very similar to plain HTML. You interpolate JavaScript code by using curly braces.", term_id:5, up_vote:0},{why:"The virtual DOM is used to speed up performance by only updated the components that need to be updated, when they need to be updated. Instead of doing a full DOM refresh.",what:"In React the virtual DOM is a lightweight representation of the actual DOM stored in memory.",how:"When the state of an object changes, Virtual DOM changes only that object in the Real DOM instead of updating all the objects and this makes things really fast.", term_id:6, up_vote:0},{why:"Events make our applications interactive and allow us to communicate better with the user.",what:"An even is an action treiggered by a User or system. (Such as a mouse click or button press)",how:"As a response to that event, a block of code is executed. This code is known as an event handler.", term_id:7, up_vote:0},{why:"We use state so a component can locally store data and use that data to influence the output of that component.",what:"State is an object that holds a component's data.",how:"State is defined inside the component and updated by using hooks or built-in functions from a class component.", term_id:8, up_vote:0},{why:"We use props to pass to share data or logic from one component to a child component.",what:"Props is short for properties. Props are properties of a component that were passed down from a parent component. Props can be data or functions." ,how:"Props are defined by when declaring a component. props are passed as an argument.", term_id:9, up_vote:0}])
